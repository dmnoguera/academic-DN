abstract: "This paper analyzes the structure of inter-sectoral relations of Argentina's economy, via network analysis tools. The research question focuses on the notion of positionality and how it can explain the power relations between capital and labor. From our point of view, the position held by the different sectors in the economic system reflects the structural advantages of the actors involved in them. 
The concept of posicionality has been addressed by different theoretical approaches from disciplines such as sociology, political economy and network theory. In this literature, position is used to highlight the multidimensionality of power relations and the structural importance of actors operating in a system. These contributions show that the strategic position of workers in an economic system gives them a “disruptive potential” to affect the normal functioning of the production process of key industries [@wright2000working; @perrone1984positional]. They also highlight the importance of divergent trajectories in sectoral profit rates [@marx1980teorias; @botwinick2017persistent] and the different levels of union organization and action [@insua2019poder] as determinants of sectoral wages. Finally, actors position in an interconnected system as been widely approached through the analysis of its structural properties. In particular, the concept of centrality in network theory allows capturing the structural importance of actors in a system [@barabasi2016network]. Therefore, centrality measures can be used as indicators of the structural power of actors through their position in the economic system. 
In short, economic sectors hold a specific position in the production network, which give rise to a particular structure whose topological characteristics express the positional dimension of union bargaining power. The complex network theory concept that captures different aspects of a node's position is centrality (reflecting the actors structural importance); so we can operationalize the concept of structural power using these measures.
The aim of this paper is: (1) to operationalize the concept of workers' positional/structural power through the analysis of the properties of the production network in Argentina; and (2) to explore its link with the sectoral wages distribution."
